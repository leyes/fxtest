# README

This repo is for miscellaneous notes and examples for learning DI in 
Golang using [Uber's Fx framework](https://github.com/uber-go/fx). These are intended for my 
own notes as I learn, criticize, try to improve and suggest patterns. The companion to this is [this blog
series](https://blog.debedb.com/tag/golang-di/).

Every subfolder here is its own GoLang project. The main here is a WiP for now.
